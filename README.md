# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption (Python)

# Overview

This project implements a Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool using Python.
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques, based on shifting letters by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
This project is designed to be simple, beginner-friendly, and educational, helping users understand the fundamentals of classical cryptography.

# History of Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it around 58–50 BC to protect military communications.
Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number (key). For example, with a shift of 3:
A → D;
B → E;
Z → C
Although it is not secure by modern standards, it is a foundational concept in cryptography and helps in understanding:
  Substitution ciphers;
  Symmetric encryption;
  Key-based encryption systems
